# GBA-Tech-Demo-V1.0

I figured out how to program my own games on the old and slow GBA and now I’m excited to share my tech demo with you! 
This is what I can push the console to do so far. I want to make it look even better in the next version. 
This level of detail was very difficult to achieve and this really has taught me extreme optimization and how to fight for every last frame per second.
